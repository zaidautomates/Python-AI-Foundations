# 🐍 Python Logic Building for AI Engineering

## 🚀 Project: Smart Expense Tracker (CLI)
This project is part of my **3-Month AI/ML Training at UET Mardan (KPITB)**. 

The goal was to move beyond basic scripts and implement **Production-Grade Logic** using Python core concepts.

### 🧠 Core Concepts Applied:
* **Data Structures:** Used `List of Dictionaries` to mimic JSON/NoSQL database structure.
* **Error Handling:** Implemented `try-except` blocks to prevent crashes on invalid user inputs (e.g., entering text instead of price).
* **Modular Architecture:** Applied the 'Single Responsibility Principle' by creating separate functions for adding, viewing, and calculating totals.
* **Search Algorithm:** Added a custom **"Filter by Category"** feature to analyze spending habits (e.g., distinct totals for Food vs. Travel).

### 🛠️ How to Run:
1. Ensure Python is installed.
2. Run the script in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python expense_tracker.py
