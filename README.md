# 🐍 Python Logic Building for AI Engineering

This repository documents my journey in the **3-Month AI/ML Training at UET Mardan (KPITB)**. 
My goal is to master the "Theory behind the Code" and build production-grade logic.

## 📂 Project 1: Smart Expense Tracker (CLI)
**File:** `expense_tracker.py`
* **Concept:** Logic building using Lists of Dictionaries.
* **Key Feature:** Custom algorithm to filter expenses by category.
* **Tech:** Error handling (`try-except`) and strict type validation.

---

## 📂 Project 2: Student Management System (CRUD)
**File:** `student_system.py`
**Status:** ✅ Completed (Day 2 Task)

A robust database simulation for managing student records. This project focuses on **Data Integrity** and **CRUD Operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

### 🧠 Engineering Logic Applied:
* **NoSQL Simulation:** Used a `List of Dictionaries` to structure data, mimicking modern Document Databases (like MongoDB).
* **Strict Validation:** * Implemented `isdigit()` checks to ensure Roll Numbers are strictly numeric.
  * Enforced logical constraints on Marks (0-100 range only).
* **Search Algorithms:** Linear search logic implemented to find, update, and delete specific records by unique IDs.
* **Modular Design:** Followed the **Single Responsibility Principle** (SRP)—each function handles exactly one task.

### 🛠️ How to Run:
**Option 1: In Terminal/VS Code**
1. Ensure Python is installed.
2. Run the specific file:
   ```bash
   python student_system.py
