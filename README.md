# 🐍 Python Logic Building for AI Engineering

## 🚀 Project: Smart Expense Tracker (CLI)
This project is part of my **3-Month AI/ML Training at UET Mardan (KPITB)**. The goal was not just to write code, but to implement **Production-Grade Logic** using Python core concepts.

### 🧠 Core Concepts Applied:
* **Data Structures:** Used `List of Dictionaries` to mimic JSON/NoSQL database structure.
* **Error Handling:** Implemented `try-except` blocks to prevent crashes on invalid user inputs.
* **Modular Architecture:** Applied the 'Single Responsibility Principle' by creating separate functions for adding, viewing, and filtering data.
* **Algorithmic Thinking:** Created a search algorithm to filter expenses by specific categories (e.g., Food, Travel).

### 🛠️ How to Run:
1. Ensure Python is installed.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python expense_tracker.py
